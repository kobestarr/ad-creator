## Overemployed & Job Scraping Research Session

### Research Completed
- Deep research on Overemployed (OE) strategy for UK
- Nick Saraev's automation methods and n8n workflows
- Salesforce Hiring Tracker service opportunity
- Job scraping automation systems

### Key Findings
1. **UK OE Requirements**: Fully remote jobs only, separate hardware, separate calendars, HMRC fine with multiple PAYE jobs
2. **Nick Saraev's Method**: Multi-page scraping + AI analysis = 5-10% response rates (vs 1-2% standard)
3. **Free Templates**: Cold Email Icebreaker Generator, Upwork Proposals, LinkedIn Connection Requests
4. **Tools Cost**: ~$150-200/month (n8n, Apollo.io, Apify, OpenAI)

### Files Created
- `/root/clawd/memory/overemployed-job-scraping-research.md` (464 lines)
- Updated `/root/clawd/memory/COMPLETE_IDEAS_LIST.md` with 5 new ideas (now 45 total)

### New Ideas Added
- Personal OE Strategy
- Nick Saraev Job Scraping Methods
- Salesforce Hiring Tracker Service (Bluprintx)
- Remote Job Scraping Subscription

## Reddit-Researcher Project (NEW)

**Goal:** Build a tool to find validated startup ideas and ICP leads from Reddit

**Inspired by:** Greg's 4-step process from video transcription (8vXoI7lUroQ)

### The 4-Step Process (from video)

1. **Find trending subreddits** (10K-100K members) - "why now" opportunities
2. **Analyze problems & solutions** - Use AI to find patterns
3. **Find creators/influencers** - Perplexity.ai or manual YouTube search
4. **Build MVP** - Wireframe based on insights

### Alternative Uses
- **ICP Research** - Find potential customers discussing problems
- **Content Ideas** - Top-performing posts reveal what audiences want
- **Competitive Analysis** - See what solutions people already use

### Technical Approach

**Option A: PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)**
- Free, but rate limited
- Good for testing/MVP
- `pip install praw`

**Option B: Apify Reddit Scraper**
- `apify.com/claredigital/reddit-scraper`
- Paid, but unlimited
- Date filters, score thresholds, nested comments

**Option C: Hybrid**
- PRAW for subreddit discovery/metadata
- Apify for deep comment scraping
- OpenAI for pattern analysis

### Tools We Have
- Apify (existing integration)
- OpenAI API (existing)
- UniScribe (existing)

### Next Steps
1. Research PRAW API limits
2. Create subreddit discovery script (find 10K-100K growing)
3. Build comment scraper for problem/solution extraction
4. Add AI pattern analysis (similar to Gummy Search summaries)
5. Export to structured format (Google Sheets, Notion)

### Naming
- **Reddit-Researcher** - Main tool
- **ICP-Finder** - Lead generation variant
- **Startup-Idea-Miner** - Startup discovery variant

## PEER REVIEW PROCESS (PERSISTENT)

### Git Hook Setup
- Location: `.git/hooks/post-push`
- Triggers on EVERY commit and push

### Two-Step Review Workflow

**STEP 1: Code Review (by Codex agent)**
- Uses: CODE_REVIEW_PROMPT.md
- Checks: Logging, Error Handling, TypeScript, Production Readiness, React/Hooks, Performance, Security, Architecture, Python specifics
- Output: List of issues found with severity levels

**STEP 2: Peer Review (by team lead - another model)**
- Uses: PEER_REVIEW_PROMPT.md
- Validates: Each Codex finding (verify code, explain invalid findings)
- Output: Confirmed issues + invalid findings + prioritized fix plan

### Key Prompts
- **CODE_REVIEW_PROMPT.md** - What Codex checks for
- **PEER_REVIEW_PROMPT.md** - How I validate Codex findings

### PEER_REVIEW_PROMPT.md Template

```
## Peer Review Analysis

### Findings Confirmed as VALID (Will Fix)
| Issue | Severity | Fix Plan |
|-------|----------|----------|
|       |          |          |

### Findings INVALIDATED (With Explanations)
| Finding | Why It's Invalid |
|---------|------------------|
|         |                  |

### Priority Action Plan
1. [HIGH] 
2. [MEDIUM] 
3. [LOW] 
```

### Critical Rules
1. **Use both prompts** - Every review must use CODE_REVIEW_PROMPT.md AND PEER_REVIEW_PROMPT.md
2. **Verify before accepting** - Check actual code, don't assume Codex is correct
3. **Explain invalid findings** - Clear reasoning, not dismissals
4. **Prioritize fixes** - Not all issues are equal
5. **Full workflow on EVERY push** - Code review → Peer review → Summary

## Credentials & APIs Blocker Tracking

**Missing Credentials:** 5 total

### 🔴 Priority 1: CRITICAL (Blockers)
1. **OpenAI API Key** - Memory search broken, cannot recall past work
   - Get: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Save to: `/root/.credentials/openai.json`

2. **Google API Credentials** - Memory embeddings broken
   - Get: https://console.cloud.google.com
   - Save to: `/root/.credentials/google.json`

### 🟡 Priority 2: IMPORTANT
3. **Strava API** - Morning health data (weight, activities)
4. **Apify Token** - Advanced web scraping

### 🟢 Priority 3: NICE TO HAVE
5. **Brave Search API** - Enhanced web search

### Morning Briefing & Standup Include:
- "🔐 Credentials missing: 5"
- "⚠️ Top blocker: OpenAI API (memory broken)"
- "Action needed: Get OpenAI key to enable full autonomy"

### Robyn's Standup Reporting:
- "I'm blocked on memory recall without OpenAI API"
- "Cannot search past research without Google credentials"
- "Need these to work autonomously"

**Tracker file:** `/root/clawd/transcription-automation/CREDENTIALS_NEEDED.md`


---

## Date/Time Validation Protocol

**Why:** LLMs often get dates wrong. Confirm at start of each briefing.

**Morning Briefing includes:**
- 📅 "Today is [DATE] - Please confirm"
- 🕐 "Time: [TIME] - Please confirm"
- ⚠️ "LLM Date Awareness: UNVERIFIED"

**After human confirms:**
- ✅ Update memory with confirmed date
- Use confirmed date for all references

**Example flow:**
```
Robyn: "Good morning! Today is [DATE] - please confirm what day it is."
Human: "Sunday February 1st"
Robyn: "✅ Confirmed: Sunday February 1st, 2026. Thank you!"
```

**Until trusted:**
- Always ask for date confirmation in briefings
- Cross-check any date references
- Don't assume I know the current date

**When trusted (after 5-7 confirmed days):**
- "LLM Date Awareness: TRUSTED"
- No longer need confirmation
