## Oktopost API Issue RESOLVED

### Background
On Feb 1, 2026, Kobi reported that the Oktopost `/v2/message?campaignId=xxx` endpoint was returning 0 results despite messages being created successfully. A support email was sent to Oktopost.

### Resolution
Oktopost support (Jason) responded:
- The `campaignId` filter works correctly — he tested and saw 27 messages
- The original issue was likely a typo on our end
- `IsAppMessage: 1` has no effect on API visibility
- `_count` alone won't work — `campaignId` is required
- No special workflow or board assignment needed for messages to appear

### Confirmed Working
- API authentication (Basic Auth)
- Create messages (POST `/v2/message`)
- List by campaign (GET `/v2/message?campaignId=xxx`)
- Get by ID (GET `/v2/message?ids=xxx` or `/v2/message/xxx`)
- Messages visible in Oktopost UI
