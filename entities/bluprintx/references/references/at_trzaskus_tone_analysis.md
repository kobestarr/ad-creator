## AT'S STRONGEST OPINIONS & BELIEFS

### 1. **People Plus AI** (Not People vs. AI)

**The Fear He Addresses:**
People worry about being displaced by AI, losing jobs.

**AT's Take:**
"It's never really about how do we have less human intervention. It's more like how do we **superpower the data our team gets** so they're just so much smarter."

**The Goal:**
"How do we not do every single thing for the first time, every single time? We're taking our lessons, our wins, who's done it before, and our lessons learned, and that builds onto the decisions we make."

**What He's Seen:**
- His personal productivity has **skyrocketed**
- Agentic capabilities put into places with proven processes + smart teams = **skyrocketed speed**
- **Never removed the person**, just accelerated outcomes

### 2. **Institutional Knowledge Loss Problem**

**AT's Observation (20 Years Career):**
"As people leave, as new people come in, as technologies change, none of those lessons learned and what's been working and the insights are... they're all just lost and they're gone."

**The AI Solution:**
"With this new intelligence AI layer, if we can bring those lessons learned and what worked and what didn't, and give that empowerment to our employees so we're not making the same mistakes others did... it all just makes us be better for our clients."

**Example:**
"Everyone just starts journeys from the beginning every single time. But if you did a journey for a retailer that was really successful, where are those lessons learned so we can use them again for the next client?"

### 3. **Foundation Before Technology**

"[Make] a strong foundation and the technology and process choices you're making that don't set you back."

### 4. **Cut Through Industry Fluff**

"The ability to read between the fluff of the industry and focus on what actually drives value."

---

## WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE (AT's Framework)

### For AI/Agentic Success:

**#1 - Executive Commitment (CEO Down):**
"It's an actual guidance from the CEO down that this is going to happen. It's not fluffy on the side. It's an **enterprise-wide engagement**."

**#2 - Continuous Involvement:**
"You have continuous thinking from start to finish. People are involved. There's a good discovery and then you do it."

**#3 - HUMAN-CENTERED WORKFLOWS (Most Important):**
"**Agentic only works when the workflows are centered around the human.**"

"When we build agents that were successful in the past, we start by saying: **'Well, how does a person do it? How does a human do it?'**"

"If all agentic use cases have to start with that full understanding, that's the only way to do these things right now."

**#4 - Clear KPIs:**
"Having a KPI - what's the real business outcome we're tracking that we're going to deliver? Because it can't be everything to everyone."

---

## WHAT BAD LOOKS LIKE

### The Warning Signs:

❌ **"When it just lives in the corner and goes there to die"**

❌ **Wrong Use Cases:**
"I was just talking to a Chief Digital Officer that said, 'Our team decided to do AI with online web translation.' Wait, what? AI can't translate that well. There's really good tools that will do that successfully for you."

❌ **Not Picking What Makes Sense:**
"Not picking the things that really make sense for them."

❌ **Tech Team Isolation:**
"The tech team will want to do something and you're not actually picking the right problem to solve."

❌ **Lack of Executive Buy-In:**
"Where it lives in a bubble and it doesn't have executive buy-in and it's just not really thoughtful enough."

❌ **"Let's Try Anything with AI":**
"The problem with 'anything' is it leads to nothing."

## AT'S FRAMEWORKS & PRINCIPLES

### Decision-Making Framework:

**1. Value + Speed Balance:**
"I really value understanding what something can drive, but also balancing that with small wins. I don't like things that take forever to get done."

"What is this going to drive in the future, but how do we speed this up to add value to the team?"

**2. Test and Learn:**
"We have to **let the data do the talking for us**."

"We can make fun of Bing or Yahoo or any paid media, but we need to test it and we need to validate what works."

**3. Rigorous Tracking:**
"How are you actually tracking what you're doing?"

**The Cookie Metaphor:**
"It's kind of like baking a cookie, right? If I bake a cookie and it didn't work, well, maybe I need more sugar. But if I add more sugar and it tastes better, that doesn't mean if I added more salt it wouldn't have tasted better, right?"

"It's kind of iterative."

**He has:** "Millions of frameworks" (his words)

### AT's One Rule for Teams:

**"You can never replace hard work."**

(Said with conviction: "Impossible.")

---

## INDUSTRY INSIGHTS (AT's POV)

### What's Changing That Leaders Need to Know:

**1. Technology Sprawl:**
"There's an incredible sprawl in how many platforms and technologies exist out there."

**2. Rising Costs:**
"All of the SaaS prices are rising all over the place."

**3. AI Washing:**
"Everyone is pretending to be AI first, but not everyone has to be. But many people should be."

**4. Employee Satisfaction Declining:**
"There's an ongoing shift in employee satisfaction that's going down."

**5. Upskilling Challenge:**
"Teams need to continue to be upskilled and that's always difficult to do."

**6. Budget Pressure:**
"Everyone is trying to do more with less, but with more technical capability. It's just really hard."

**7. Underused Investments:**
"There's so many underused technology investments all over that aren't getting done."

**8. Lack of Impact Measurement:**
"No one understands the impact of what they're driving to see if it's actually being successful or not."

---

## THE BORING TRUTH THAT ACTUALLY WORKS

### PowerPoint as Canvas:

**AT's Passion Point:**
"PowerPoint is the canvas that we work on, and our clients' executives work on. **You have to get that right** to be able to storytell."

"So many people try to get away with it or don't invest the time. But the difference in trying to get an investment or to teach people something or to show a plan or to get people inspired - that ability, how it lives on paper, **so f***ing important**."

"People just don't understand that."

**Translation:**
PowerPoint = The storytelling canvas of the business world. Master it or lose.

### Tracking & KPIs:

**"What gets tracked gets done."**

"It's so important and executives still miss it - that they're not tracking to specific KPIs and specific value drivers."

## WHAT BLUPRINTX DOES (AT's Words)

"We bring both **advisory and technology expertise** to help them solve some of their biggest issues across **the front office** - the front office being **every single touch point you can have with the customer** - and helping them drive their businesses forward."

---

## WHY CLIENTS CHOOSE BLUPRINTX

**AT's Positioning:**

"Because we have **enterprise-proven success with boutique agility** and we were proven in **regulated industries that require a lot of compliance, data, and privacy**, with a nice mix of **next-gen capabilities across AI**."

"Our internal BPXOS operating system that we're going to scale and blow out globally across every single department."

### 2. **Fortune 500 Impact as Small Team**
"That we were able to have such tremendous impact on Fortune 500 clients' front office as a small team - just kind of our ways of working - that's going to be much differentiated in the market."

---

## COMPETITORS

### Direct Competitors:

**Large GSIs:**
- Deloitte
- Accenture
- "They're in all of the large global clients globally. They're just everywhere."

**Agency-LED Groups:**
- Merkle (Dentsu)
- Sapient
- "The other Publicis that have agency-led pillars because they're just in the same business as us: marketing, commerce, service."

**Boutique Players:**
"Obviously thousands of boutique ones, but the large ones are the most critical as we go up in market."

---

## WHO AT ADMIRES

### Palantir (Specific Positioning Strategy):

**What He Loves:**
"They brought this AI layer that I think they call Ontology... which is basically a story of: **'You can't use an LLM because it's too big and broad for you. We build another layer that makes it specific to you.'**"

**Why It Works:**
"Just f***ing blows me away. That positioning because you:
1. Differentiate yourself
2. Have a layer that's much different than anyone else
3. Show that you understand that space, that element significantly better than anyone else
4. Can optimize it for them"

"I just absolutely love that."

## EXAMPLE AT VOICE APPLICATIONS

### ❌ WRONG (What AT Would Reject):

"99% of companies are getting AI wrong. Here's what they need to know about implementing agents in 2025. #AI #Innovation"

*(Generic percentage, no credibility anchor, fluffy)*

### ✅ RIGHT (AT's Style):

"After 20+ conversations with Fortune 500 CDOs this quarter, one pattern keeps showing up:

Their AI pilots keep dying in corners.

Not because the tech doesn't work. But because they're building agents without understanding how humans actually do the work.

Here's what the successful ones do differently:

They start with a simple question: 'How does a person do this task right now?'

Only then do they build the agent around that workflow.

Result? One retailer went from 8-month implementation cycles to 45 days. Same team size. Same budget. Different approach.

**Agentic only works when workflows are centered around humans.**

The technology should superpower your people, not replace their intuition.
