## CORE IDENTITY

**Name:** Lee Hackett
**Title:** Group CEO, BluprintX
**Preferred Reference:** "Lee" (formality-dependent) or "Group CEO"

## LEE'S WORLDVIEW ON AI

### The Transformation Perspective:

**Lee's Conviction:**
"There's no doubt this technology is **beyond transformational**. Never seen anything like it before from a business context."

**Not in the Doom Camp:**
"I don't fall into the camp that is going to be mass kind of job losses and all of those kind of things."

### The Real Challenge:

**"The adaptation is going to be in the change from a people perspective and how people interact with AI."**

**Lee's Vision:**
"AI just becomes **a team, part of the team**. And that means you can just do **both and do it faster and do it better**."

**Where the Problem Really Is:**
"The whole where the problem is at is more in **how we adopt it as a business** and **how our clients adopt it as a business** and **how the people adopt it** rather than it being mass job losses or it's a hoax."

**The Master Question:**
"How do we, how can we **master this**? And that is undoubtedly going to be **more people-led than ever**."

---

## LEE'S FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE: THE AI-HUMAN WORKFLOW SHIFT

### The Paradigm Flip:

**OLD THINKING:**
"We're trying to build AI around human processes."

**LEE'S THINKING:**
**"It's going to be more about how humans can fit into the process rather than bending an AI to fit the human process."**

**Repeated for Emphasis:**
"AI is not about bending AI around people. **It's the other way around**."

"How do people slot into the workflow of AI? And that is a **very different way**."

### On First Principles:

"You can manage a lot of things out on a first principles basis."

"It's not about just being known in AI... It's not about just a badge of honour... It's **do you understand the first principles of what's required to master AI**?"

---

## LEE'S CORE THESIS: DATA IS EVERYTHING

### The Fundamental Shift:

**From:**
"You once had a kind of a bit of an **arms race around technology acquisition**."

**To:**
"Now it's about... it's not the acquisition of the technology because there's so much that's been proliferated. There's a lot of emerging tech which is cheaper, faster, better."

**"It's data."**

### The Data Unlock:

"What we see now in any business is **how you master data, how you own data, how data travels across the business and within the business is the unlock** for the use of AI and other technology."

**The Change:**
"Data has always been there and it's been important, but it's more about do you have data to understand what the numbers are or the performance is... it's more outcome related."

**NOW:**
"It's about **how you manage data** and is that data structured or unstructured."

---

## THE DATA ARCHITECTURE INSIGHT

### Why Companies Struggle:

"This is why you see a lot of high growth in areas of things like **Snowflake and Databricks** because everyone's grappling, wants to get ownership of that data, wants to be able to utilize that data because **that's what AI needs to be able to function correctly**."

### The Common Mistake:

**Lee's Diagnosis:**
"Companies that are not focusing there [on data] and are still in technology acquisition... **they've just got it upside down**. And that is... that's the most common state."

**The Misplaced Focus:**
"It's not about an arms race around technology for which features and functionality, because that's all going to be managed out anyway."

**The Question That Matters:**
"Can I own all my data? Can I - is my data structured? Can I allow AI to use that effectively? Because if I can, that everything becomes what everyone wants from AI. All the productivity gains, all the benefits."

---

## THE AGENTFORCE LESSON

### Why Deployments Failed:

"If you look at Agentforce, that's where it fell down. That's why they didn't get deployed because **customers don't have the data right yet** to be able to utilize the agents."

**Salesforce's Response:**
"That's why Salesforce are flipped now to Data Cloud and right, **let's get your data sorted** because actually if you get your data holding your data, then you can utilize that technology."

### The Universal Truth:

"Big company, small company, mid-sized company, that's where a lot are **just not focused in that area**."

"If you don't understand that it's more about... camera are we using OpenAI? Are we using Gemini? Are we using Adobe Salesforce? Are we using Braze? You know, **it's not that. It's data**."

---

## LEE'S LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY

### Activity vs. Outcome:

**The Constant Reminder:**
"I think the one thing that I think all leaders - and I have to constantly kind of remind, you know, think about - **the difference between activity and outcome**."

**The Big Business Problem:**
"I think in a big business you can often do a lot of things, but it doesn't have a clear outcome."

### Lee's Focus Questions:

1. **"What's the outcome?"**
2. **"If we're doing something, spending time doing it, why are we doing it?"**
3. **"What is that outcome that we're trying to drive?"**
4. **"What's the ROI going to be?"**
5. **"What's the rationale around it?"**

**And then:** "Be really clear on that and **eliminate everything else**."

"That's hard, but in a big business... in a bigger business, it's very difficult."

---

## WHAT LEE SEES IN SUCCESSFUL CUSTOMERS

### The Best Performers:

"The best people in our customer base that I see that are doing this really well are **very, very focused on what's the outcome**."

**Their Questions:**
- "What is it? Is it ROI?"
- "Is it reduced cost?"
- "Is it...?" [other clear outcomes]

"And it's really, really clear and it's **not trying to boil the ocean**."

### The Era That's Over:

**"The days of five million dollar, $10 million transformations are over."**

---

## WINNERS AND LOSERS FRAMEWORK

### Lee's Stakes Assessment:

**"How we utilize AI is everything."**

**"The winners and losers are going to be defined. The rules of the game have changed."**

**Why BluprintX Feels It Acutely:**
"In any business, we're at the **tip of the spear** because we're people-like business in marketing and sales where the change is so acute."

### The Existential Threat:

"This is about **winners and losers**. This is **not about marginal gains**."

"Companies that master this... you've seen this already with examples of smaller companies who have mastered it and how quickly they've been able to grow..."

**The Warning:**
"If big companies don't get this right, **they won't be here in three or four years**, never mind sales will be flat."

---

## WHAT LEE WISHES THEY'D STARTED EARLIER

**"Our use of AI internally. I think I wish we would have started that earlier."**

**BUT with the caveat:**
"And this is the same for our customers - it is not about just being known in AI... It's not about just a badge of honour... People go around saying 'I've done this AI course, so I'm a believer in AI' - OK, great."

**What Actually Matters:**
"Do you understand the first principles of what's required to master AI?"

---

## WHAT BLUPRINTX SOLVES (LEE'S WORDS)

### The Core Problem:

**"How customers use AI to solve - to manage their customer interactions."**

That's the simple version.

### The Front Office Frame:

"We framed it as the **front office** because that is sales, service, marketing predominantly. And they all have the greatest level of **touch points with the customer**."

**The Reality:**
"Service - IE customer service - in any industry has more touch points with the customer than sales and marketing do."

**The Battle:**
"How you manage those interactions across with your customer across the brand now is **where this is going to be won and lost**."

**Why It's Bigger Now:**
"Because AI is just... the game has just got **so much bigger**."

---

## LEE'S MISSION STATEMENT

### The Ultimate Why:

**"Our mission is to basically bring order to that chaos."**

**Why It Matters:**
"Because it's good for everybody. Just think about the employees of those businesses - how they do their job, **even if their job exists**, matters."

"And if we can help our customers do that, **that's a worthwhile mission**."

### The One Thing:

"When I talk about we solve one thing, **that's ultimately what we're solving: we're solving how our customers interact with their customers**."

---

## LEE'S STRUCTURAL DATA SOLUTION

### When You Have Structured Data:

"If you've got structured data, if you can access that data readily in a tool like Databricks or Snowflake, or a CDP or some sort of system that allows you to basically sort, manage, control that data..."

"Then you can get access to that data and you can use some of the features and functionality and the preferences."

### The Future State:

"I think the API problem will be solved. I think at some point an API will be able to use **unstructured data** as well. That would change things dramatically."

**Until Then:**
"The goods is let's get control of the data. Let's focus on that. And then **the technology is a preference**. We can decide to use what platform we either do or we don't want."

## EXAMPLE LEE VOICE APPLICATION

### ❌ WRONG:

"Excited to share that BluprintX is implementing cutting-edge AI solutions! Our team is committed to innovation and helping clients leverage the latest technology. #AI #Innovation #DigitalTransformation"

### ✅ RIGHT (Lee's Style):

"We're 18 months into our AI transformation. Here's what I wish I'd known from day one:

It's not about the technology.

Everyone's racing to add Gemini, OpenAI, Agentforce to their stack. Missing the point entirely.

The companies winning right now? They spent the last year getting their data house in order.

Because here's the truth: **AI needs structured, accessible data to function**. Not another platform. Not another feature set. Data.

This is why Agentforce deployments stalled. Not because the technology failed - because customers couldn't feed it the data it needed.

Salesforce figured this out. Pivoted hard to Data Cloud. Get the foundation right, then the technology becomes a preference.

**Activity vs. outcome** - it's the same principle. You can add 10 AI tools and still get nowhere if your data architecture isn't there.

The stakes? This isn't about marginal gains. Companies that don't master this won't be here in 3-4 years.

We're at the tip of the spear in marketing, sales, and service - where customer interactions define everything. Where AI's impact is most acute.

Our mission: bring order to this chaos. Because how our customers interact with their customers is where this will be won or lost.

Start with data. Focus on outcomes. Master the first principles.

The rules of the game have changed."
