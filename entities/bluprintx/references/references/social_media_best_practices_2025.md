## LinkedIn Best Practices

### Algorithm Understanding (2025)
**Three-Step Process:**
1. **Quality Filtering** - Posts classified as spam, low quality, or high quality
2. **Engagement Testing** - First hour performance determines wider distribution
3. **Network & Relevance Ranking** - Prioritizes people/topics you engage with most

**Key Algorithm Changes in 2025:**
- Emphasizes **expertise** and **original insights** more than ever
- Rewards **active creators** and **subject-matter experts**
- Penalizes **engagement bait** (e.g., "Comment YES if you agree!")
- Prioritizes **dwell time** (how long users engage with content)
- Pushes **native content** over posts with outbound links (put links in comments instead)
- Shows **older posts** (2-3 weeks old) if more relevant to professional interests
- **Evergreen content** continues reaching people well after posting

### Current Performance Metrics (2025)
- Average engagement rate: **5.20%** (H1 2025)
- Good target engagement rate: **4%+**
- Reach down **50%** for many users vs 2024
- Engagement down **25%** overall
- Follower growth down **59%**
- **First 30-60 minutes** after posting are crucial for reach

### Top Performing Content Formats (2025)

**By Engagement Rate (Company Pages):**
1. **Multi-image posts** - 6.60% engagement rate (BEST for likes)
2. **Native carousels/documents** - 5.85% engagement rate  
3. **Videos** - 5.60% engagement rate (most shared format, 3rd highest engagement)
4. **Polls** - 1.64x reach multiplier (highest impressions in 2025)
5. **Text posts** - Work for personal profiles (1.17x reach) but terrible for company pages (0.46x reach)

**Key Insights:**
- Polls have **24% increase** in reach multiplier vs 2023-2024
- Multi-image posts naturally encourage **swipes** = engagement signals
- Videos under **90 seconds** perform best
- Brand pages with 100K+ followers get up to **2K views per video**

### Hook Strategy (CRITICAL)
**The first 2 lines determine engagement.** If your hook doesn't stop the scroll, nothing else matters.

**Effective Hook Techniques:**
- Start with **bold statements** or **controversial takes**
- Use **specific, surprising statistics**
- Ask **captivating questions**
- Share **surprising facts**
- Make **clear value promises**
- Create **curiosity gaps**
- Lead with **contrarian insights**

### Post Length & Formatting
**Optimal Character Count:**
- **800-1,000 characters** = sweet spot
- Text posts **1,800-2,100 characters** see peak reach for personal profiles
- Under 1,000 characters loses **25% potential engagement**

**Formatting Best Practices:**
- Use **line breaks generously** for readability
- **Minimize hashtags** - they have NO impact on reach in 2025
- 3-5 hashtags can **slightly reduce** visibility
- 6+ hashtags can **seriously sabotage** reach
- Maximum **3 hashtags** if using any
- Hashtag pages disabled October 2024; hashtags no longer clickable on desktop

### Link Strategy
**Critical Finding - Links HURT Reach:**
- Posts with **1 link** perform WORST (lowest reach)
- Posts with **2-3 links** don't improve much
- Posts with **4+ links** see **3-5x higher median reach** (signals value, not promotion)
- **Best practice:** Either use 0 links OR bundle 3-5 relevant links
- **Alternative:** Post without links, add link in **first comment** instead

### Video Specifications (AVOID PIXELATION)

**Critical Video Quality Settings:**
- **Format:** MP4 with H.264 codec and AAC audio (REQUIRED)
- **Resolution:** 1080p (1920x1080) is optimal - DO NOT upload 4K
- **Bitrate:** **8,000-10,000 kbps** for 1080p to avoid pixelation after LinkedIn compression
  - Minimum: 5,000 kbps
  - This is THE most important factor for post-upload quality
- **Frame Rate:** 24-30 fps recommended for natural motion
- **File Size:** Max 5GB for organic posts, but keep under 200MB for best performance
- **Duration:** 
  - Organic: 3 seconds to 10 minutes (15 min on desktop)
  - Ads: Up to 30 minutes
  - **Best practice:** Under 60 seconds for maximum engagement

**Aspect Ratios (by Priority):**
1. **4:5 (Vertical)** - 1080x1350 pixels - BEST for mobile (dominates screen)
2. **1:1 (Square)** - 1080x1080 pixels - Good for all devices
3. **16:9 (Horizontal)** - 1920x1080 pixels - Good for desktop
4. **9:16 (Full Vertical)** - 1080x1920 pixels - Mobile only for ads

**Video Best Practices:**
- Add **hook in first 3 seconds**
- Always include **subtitles** (videos autoplay muted)
- Keep under **90 seconds**
- Use **native video** (upload directly, don't link to YouTube)
- Avoid watermarks from other platforms
- Set pixel aspect ratio to **"Square Pixels (1.0)"** in export settings

### Posting Strategy
**Frequency:**
- **3-5 posts per week** optimal
- More than 5 posts/week can cause engagement fatigue
- **20 posts per month** reaches ~60% of audience
- Consistency matters more than frequency

**Best Times to Post:**
- **Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday** between **9 AM - 12 PM** (peak times)
- Second window: **5 PM - 6 PM** (after work)
- **Weekends** can boost reach by 50% due to less competition (only 8% of content posted)
- Test your specific audience - no universal "best time"

**Schedule by Funnel Stage (Your Weekly Plan):**
- Monday: Middle of funnel
- Tuesday: **Top of funnel**
- Wednesday: Middle of funnel  
- Thursday: **Bottom of funnel** (main CTA/action day)
- Friday: **Top of funnel** (lighter)

### Engagement Tactics
**First Hour Critical Actions:**
- Engage with **5+ other posts** immediately after publishing
- Respond to comments quickly (ideally within **2 hours**)
- Encourage internal team to engage when post goes live
- Avoid high percentage of own comments (can trigger reach penalty)
- Ask questions to invite community responses

**Long-term Engagement:**
- **Comment quality > likes** (comments carry more algorithmic weight)
- Build "LinkedIn mafia" - reciprocal engagement groups
- Tag relevant experts for insights
- Use "notify employees" feature for company page posts
- Posts with **5+ comments** more likely shown to wider audience

### Company Page vs Personal Profile Differences

**Company Pages:**
- Organic posts are nearly **invisible** in feed without strategy
- Text-only posts perform terribly (0.46x reach)
- Videos perform better (1.4x reach) than on personal profiles
- **Employee advocacy critical** - reshare employee content
- Requires more sophisticated content strategy

**Personal Profiles:**
- Better organic reach overall
- Text posts work (1.17x reach)
- Videos slightly lower reach (1.17x) than company pages
- **Expertise signals matter** - consistent posting on niche topics
- LinkedIn identifies you as expert = wider content distribution

### Content Mix Best Practices
- **80% helpful/educational content**
- **20% promotional content** 
- Mix formats: carousels, videos, polls, multi-image
- Behind-the-scenes content performs well
- Use **data-rich visuals** (charts, infographics)
- Share **original case studies** and real results
- **Storytelling beats corporate speak**

## Instagram Reels Best Practices

### Algorithm Understanding (2025)
**Ranking Factors:**
- **Watch time** (completion rate is crucial)
- **Likes** (matter more for followers)
- **Sends** (more important for reaching new audiences)
- **Engagement velocity** (likes, comments, shares, saves in first hour)
- **Audio trends** (using popular/trending audio increases discovery)
- **Content quality** (high-resolution video, no watermarks)
- **User relationships** (previous interactions boost visibility)
- **Account authority** (consistent engagement patterns)

**How Distribution Works:**
- Small group sees your Reel first
- If they engage, gets more exposure
- Algorithm emphasizes **original content** over reposts
- Reels can be up to **3 minutes** (as of Jan 2025), but shorter is better

### Performance Metrics (2025)
- Reels achieve **2.46% engagement rate** (vs Instagram's 2% average)
- Over **2 billion users** engage with Reels monthly
- **200 billion Reels** viewed daily across Instagram and Facebook
- Completion rate under **30 seconds**: 200% lift in view completion

### Content Strategy

**Hook Critical (First 3 Seconds):**
- Start with **movement** or **clear focal point** (face/close-up)
- Avoid static wide angles or long intros
- Many successful creators start with the **END of the video** as hook
- Use **pattern interrupts**: bold statements, questions, numbers

**Optimal Length:**
- Can be up to 3 minutes, but **shorter is better**
- **Under 30 seconds** perform best
- Aim for length that delivers message **concisely**
- High **completion rates** favored by algorithm

**Visual Requirements:**

- **1080x1920 pixels** (full vertical)
- Also works: 4:5 (1080x1350) or 1:1 (1080x1080)
- Shoot **natively vertical** - don't repurpose horizontal
- Avoid **low resolution** or **pixelated** videos
- Never use **watermarks** from other apps (TikTok, etc.) - algorithm penalizes

**Text & Accessibility:**
- Huge portion watch with **sound off**
- Use **text overlays** and **on-screen text**
- Add **captions** for comprehension
- Use Instagram's **text-to-speech** feature
- Animated text keeps engagement high

**Audio Strategy:**
- Use **trending audio** for algorithmic boost
- Instagram recognizes familiar sounds
- Creates shared experience, lowers barrier to entry
- Trending audio frames content for success
- Keep audio **fresh** with latest trending sounds

**Calls to Action:**
- Use CTAs like **"save this for later"** or **"tag a friend"**
- Drives engagement, signals value to algorithm
- Not every Reel needs CTA
- Best for educational/informative Reels
- Avoid CTAs when using trending audio (let audio be focus)

### Posting Strategy

**Frequency:**
- **Consistency** matters more than frequency
- **2-3 high-quality Reels per week** better than daily mediocre content
- Quality Reels continue generating engagement for weeks

**Best Times (General):**
