**Title**: "Land 5 Podcast Interviews in 30 Days: The Exact System I Use for Clients"

**Body**:
> I've helped 200+ entrepreneurs get featured on podcasts, and I'm sharing the exact system we use to land 5+ interviews in 30 days.
> 
> **Step 1: Target the Right Shows**
> Don't aim for Joe Rogan. Target shows with 1k-50k downloads that reach your exact customer. Use ListenNotes to filter by category and audience size.
> 
> **Step 2: Craft Your Hook**
> Lead with their audience's pain point, not your story. Example: "I help e-commerce owners reduce ad costs by 40% using email sequences."
> 
> **Step 3: The Pitch Template That Works**
> Subject: "Story idea for [Podcast Name] audience"
> 
> "Hi [Host name],

> 
> [Hook] - I can share the 3-step framework that [specific result] without [common objection].
> 
> Would this serve your listeners? Happy to adjust the angle.

> [Your name]"
>

**Title**: "Podcast Guesting Generated £47k for My Business: Here's the Math"
> 
> Last year I decided to systemize podcast guesting for my consulting business. Here's the exact ROI breakdown:
> 
> **Investment**: 20 hours total (prep + interviews)
> **Results**: 12 interviews → 87 website visits → 23 discovery calls → 8 clients
> **Revenue**: £47,500 from £0 ad spend
> 
> **The key**: Targeting shows that reach decision-makers in my niche (SaaS founders).
> 
> **My process**:
> 1. Research shows using Chartable/ListenNotes
> 2. Pitch with specific value for their audience
> 3. Prepare 3 actionable takeaways (no selling)
> 4. Mention free resource (gets 15-20% of listeners to visit site)
> 5. Follow up with listeners who reach out
> 
> Biggest mistake I see: People pitch themselves instead of the value they can provide to listeners.
> 
> Happy to answer questions about the process - it's been a game-changer for my client acquisition.
